# Yokiko Gaming Platform - Architecture Documentation

## System Overview

The Yokiko Gaming Platform is a decentralized gaming platform that leverages blockchain technology to enable secure, transparent, and rewarding gaming experiences. The platform combines web technologies with blockchain to create a unique gaming ecosystem where players can compete, place bets, and earn rewards.

## Architecture Layers

The system is organized into the following layers:

### 1. Presentation Layer

- **React Frontend**: Built using React and TypeScript, this layer handles the UI/UX of the gaming platform.
- **Responsive Design**: Implements responsive design principles for cross-device compatibility.
- **Component Library**: Utilizes shadcn/ui components for a consistent look and feel.

### 2. Application Layer

- **Game Logic**: Contains the core game mechanics and rules for each game.
- **State Management**: Manages global and local state using React context and hooks.
- **Authentication**: Handles user authentication and wallet connections.

### 3. Service Layer

- **API Services**: Provides RESTful API endpoints for frontend-backend communication.
- **Game Services**: Manages game sessions, matchmaking, and scoring.
- **Blockchain Services**: Interfaces with blockchain for transactions and smart contract interactions.

### 4. Data Layer

- **Database**: PostgreSQL database for storing user information, game matches, and scores.
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum and ICP blockchains for decentralized aspects of the platform.
- **Storage Interface**: Abstraction layer for database operations.

### 5. Infrastructure Layer

- **Hosting**: Uses Replit for development and deployment.
- **CI/CD**: Implements continuous integration and deployment pipelines.
- **Monitoring**: Monitors system health and performance metrics.

## Key Components

### Frontend Components

1. **User Interface**: 
   - Game interfaces for different games (Tetris, Temple Runner, Street Fighter)
   - Dashboard for user profile and statistics
   - Betting interfaces for wagering

2. **Authentication**:
   - Web3 wallet integration using Abstract Global Wallet
   - User session management

3. **Game Components**:
   - Game boards and controllers
   - Scoring and level systems
   - Multiplayer coordination

### Backend Components

1. **API Server**:
   - Express server providing RESTful endpoints
   - User management and authentication
   - Game session management

2. **Database**:
   - User profiles and credentials
   - Game match records
   - Leaderboards and statistics

3. **Blockchain Integration**:
   - Smart contract interfaces
   - Transaction management
   - Wallet connections

### Smart Contracts

1. **GameBets Contract**:
   - Manages betting between players
   - Handles both ETH and ERC20 token bets
   - Provides secure payout mechanisms

2. **Game Factory** (Planned):
   - Creates and manages game instances
   - Handles game deployment and registration

## Data Flow

### User Registration Flow

1. User connects their Web3 wallet via Abstract Global Wallet
2. System creates a new user profile in the database
3. User receives access to their personalized dashboard

### Game Matchmaking Flow

1. User selects a game to play
2. System finds a suitable opponent
3. Game match is created and recorded in the database
4. Players are notified and game begins

### Betting Flow

1. User creates a bet for a specific match
2. Funds are locked in the smart contract
3. Another user accepts the bet
4. System monitors the match outcome
5. Smart contract pays out to the winner

## Deployment Architecture

### Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) Deployment

The platform will be deployed on ICP using the following architecture:

1. **Frontend Canister**:
   - Contains all static assets (HTML, CSS, JS)
   - Implements user interface components
   - Communicates with backend canisters

2. **Backend Canisters**:
   - User management canister
   - Game logic canister
   - Data storage canister

3. **Integration Layer**:
   - Bridge between ICP and Ethereum for cross-chain operations
   - Handles wallet connections and authentications

## Security Architecture

1. **Authentication Security**:
   - Web3 wallet-based authentication
   - Session management with secure cookies

2. **Smart Contract Security**:
   - Reentrancy protection
   - Access control mechanisms
   - Secure transaction handling

3. **Data Security**:
   - Encrypted sensitive user data
   - Secure API endpoints
   - Input validation and sanitization

## Scaling Strategy

1. **Horizontal Scaling**:
   - Multiple instances of game servers
   - Load balancing across instances

2. **Database Scaling**:
   - Database sharding for high-volume data
   - Read replicas for improved performance

3. **ICP Canister Scaling**:
   - Multiple canister instances
   - Cross-canister communication optimization

## Technology Stack

1. **Frontend**:
   - React with TypeScript
   - TailwindCSS for styling
   - shadcn/ui components
   - Three.js/Babylon.js for 3D games
